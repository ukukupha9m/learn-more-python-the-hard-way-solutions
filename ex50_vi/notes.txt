* Use python re library for the regex portions.
* Need a buffer class that understands the commands.
* Parser then works this buffer class to process the file.
* No need for analysis, but could have the parser produce small command objects.
* Parser could also just make a list of buffer class functions that get called as closures.
* DUUUUHHHHHHH Buffer is an FSM.
